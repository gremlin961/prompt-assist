# Prompt Assist Tool
# A Python web service for creating and testing prompts for Generative AI models

This Python web service provides a tool for creating and testing prompts for Generative AI models. It allows users to:
Enrich prompts by providing additional context.
Compare the effectiveness of different prompts using the PaLM text-bison model.
Compare the output of different Generative AI models for the same prompt.
The service uses the FastAPI framework, Jinja2 for templating, and a custom library for interacting with the PaLM model.
